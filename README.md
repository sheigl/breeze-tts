## 📰 News

- **[2026.08.25]** 🎉 We open-source [Breeze TTS 2](https://huggingface.co/BreezeBlue/breeze-tts-2) model weights and the [PyTorch inference code](https://github.com/breezeblue-ai/breeze-tts).
- **[2026.08.07]** 🔥 We release the TTS benchmark suite for [voice design](https://github.com/breezeblue-ai/tts-voice-design-benchmark), [voice direction](https://github.com/breezeblue-ai/TTS-Voice-Direction-Benchmark), and [latency evaluation](https://github.com/breezeblue-ai/TTS-Latency-Benchmark).

## 📖 Introduction

Breeze TTS 2 is an open-weight text-to-speech model built for real-time interaction. It ranks #1 among open-weight models on the Artificial Analysis TTS leaderboard, while outperforming frontier proprietary systems. Its open-ended natural-language instruction-following capability supports reference-free voice design and reference-guided voice direction, while ultra-low-latency streaming enables responsive, expressive interaction.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🎙️ **Voice Clone** — Uses reference audio with its exact transcript to preserve timbre, rhythm, emotion, and style.
- 🎨 **Voice Design** — Creates a distinctive voice from a natural-language description, without reference audio.
- 🎛️ **Voice Direction** — Clones a voice from reference audio while steering tone, emotion, pace, and delivery.
- 🎭 **Vocal Events** — Adds expressive inline events directly in the text: use parentheses in English, such as `(laugh)`, `(cough)`, `(clears throat)`, and `(sigh)`; use square brackets in Chinese, such as `[笑]`, `[咳嗽]`, `[清嗓子]`, and `[叹气]`.
- ⚡ **Ultra-Low Latency** — Achieves under 40 ms time to first audio (TTFA) with the warmed-up fast path on an NVIDIA H100.
- 🌊 **Real-Time Streaming** — Reaches a 0.32 real-time factor (RTF), generating audio at approximately 3.1× real time with the warmed-up fast path on an NVIDIA H100.
- 💾 **GPU-Efficient** — Eager inference uses approximately 7.7 GiB of GPU memory; a 12 GB GPU is the minimum recommended configuration.
- 🌏 **Bilingual Support** — Generates natural English and Chinese speech with a single model.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

- Linux and Python 3.12 or newer
- A CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU or an Intel XPU (e.g. Arc B-series) with the Intel PyTorch XPU build of `torch`
- GPU memory: approximately 7.7 GiB for eager inference or 14.4 GiB with `--fast-all`; use a 12 GB GPU for eager or a 24 GB GPU for the fast path
- The Breeze TTS 2 checkpoint

### Installation

Download the inference code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/breezeblue-ai/breeze-tts.git
cd breeze-tts
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All required model components are included in the Breeze TTS 2 checkpoint.

Alternatively, manage the environment with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended for XPU):

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

This installs `torch` and `torchaudio` from the Intel PyTorch XPU wheel index automatically. Run inference:

```bash
uv run python infer.py ../breeze-tts-2 \
  --text "(sigh) It is good to hear your voice again." \
  --output outputs/voice_en.wav
```

Run the tests and linter:

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
```

For the tested CUDA environment, build the included Docker image:

```bash
bash docker/build.sh
```

The default image targets H100/Hopper (sm90). For A100:

```bash
FLASH_ATTN_CUDA_ARCHS=80 bash docker/build.sh
```

### 🎙️ Voice Clone

Clone a speaker from clean reference audio and its exact transcript.

#### English

```bash
python infer.py ../breeze-tts-2 \
  --ref-audio reference_en.wav \
  --ref-text "This is the exact transcript of the English reference audio." \
  --text "(sigh) It is good to hear your voice again after all this time." \
  --output outputs/voice_clone_en.wav
```

#### Chinese

```bash
python infer.py ../breeze-tts-2 \
  --ref-audio reference_zh.wav \
  --ref-text "这是中文参考音频的准确文字稿。" \
  --text "[叹气] 没想到过了这么久，你还记得我的声音。" \
  --output outputs/voice_clone_zh.wav
```

Reference audio should contain clean speech with minimal background noise.

### 🎨 Voice Design

Create a voice from a natural-language description without reference audio. Match the instruction language to the target text. Use `--cfg-scale 4` to strengthen instruction-following.

#### English

```bash
python infer.py ../breeze-tts-2 \
  --text "(sigh) Welcome aboard. Your journey begins now." \
  --instruction "A warm, thoughtful young woman with a clear voice and a calm, reflective delivery." \
  --cfg-scale 4 \
  --output outputs/voice_design_en.wav
```

#### Chinese

```bash
python infer.py ../breeze-tts-2 \
  --text "[笑] 欢迎来到今晚的故事时间，让我们一起开始吧。" \
  --instruction "一位温柔自信的年轻女性，声音清晰，语气亲切，表达轻快而富有感染力。" \
  --cfg-scale 4 \
  --output outputs/voice_design_zh.wav
```

### 🎛️ Voice Direction

Keep the identity of a reference speaker while directing tone, emotion, pace, and delivery. Use `--cfg-scale 4` to strengthen instruction-following.

```bash
python infer.py ../breeze-tts-2 \
  --ref-audio reference.wav \
  --ref-text "This is the exact transcript of the reference audio." \
  --text "(clears throat) We need to discuss what happened last night." \
  --instruction "Speak slowly with a restrained, serious tone." \
  --cfg-scale 4 \
  --output outputs/voice_direction.wav
```

### 🌐 Streaming API

Start the single-concurrency streaming API. It uses the same PyTorch runtime and eager execution by default:

```bash
python -m breeze_infer.api ../breeze-tts-2 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860
```

Send a Voice Direction request with reference audio and CFG 4:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7860/v1/audio/speech \
  -F "cfg_scale=4" \
  -F "ref_audio=@reference.wav" \
  -F "ref_text=This is the exact transcript of the reference audio." \
  -F "text=(clears throat) We need to discuss what happened last night." \
  -F "instruction=Speak slowly with a restrained, serious tone." \
  -F "seed=42" \
  --output voice_direction.pcm
```

The response is streaming mono 24 kHz signed 16-bit little-endian PCM. Start the API with `--fast-all` to enable the fast path.

### ⚡ Fast Inference Options

Both the CLI and API use eager streaming by default and skip graph warmup. Pass `--fast-all` to enable the best configuration for every inference stage when the additional cold-start time is acceptable. Each stage can also be controlled independently:

| Stage | Fast parameter | Disabled | Enabled |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text encoder | `--[no-]fast-text-encoder` | Native eager forward | Static CUDA Graph selected by CFG shape and text-length bucket |
| Backbone prefill | `--[no-]fast-backbone-prefill` | Native eager prefill | CUDA Graph selected by CFG shape and prompt-length bucket |
| Backbone decode | `--[no-]fast-backbone-decode` | Native eager token step | StaticCache-backed graph selected by CFG shape |
| Depth decoder | `--[no-]fast-depth-decoder` | Native eager depth loop | Full-graph compilation with CFG-shape CUDA Graphs |
| Codec | `--[no-]fast-codec` | Eager streaming decode | Single-request streaming CUDA Graph with one-frame chunks |

Individual stage flags are intended for profiling and debugging.
